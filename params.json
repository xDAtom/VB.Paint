{"name":"VB.Paint","tagline":"VB.Paint, a simple image editing program","body":"### Welcome to VB.Paint's official Website\r\nVB.Paint is a lightweight image editing program. It is designed in a way to simplify image editing.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nThe program features very simple image editing. You can load images for editing, or save the edited (or drawn) images. The brush can be customized in size, color and shape. The color system uses RGB values, which the user needs to specify (from the RGB chart included with the program). The shape of the brush can be changed into Circle or Square. Of course, a Text Tool is implemented, allowing you to write text on your image. The Font Size and Color can be changed. The brush/text can be previewed with a special Preview feature, so there is no experimenting on the image.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n![404 Image Not Found](http://i.imgur.com/CnSFbGv.png)\r\n\r\n![404 Image Not Found](http://i.imgur.com/Trav1ZZ.png)\r\n\r\n![404 Image Not Found](http://i.imgur.com/nG4iBYq.png)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2014, Dominik Matijaca (@xDAtom) founded the VB.Paint project.
