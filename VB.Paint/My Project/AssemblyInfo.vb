<Assembly: AssemblyTitle("VB.Paint")> 
<Assembly: AssemblyDescription("VB.Paint is a lightweight image editing program for fun! And yes I know it's crap. Coded in VB2008, it can only draw an 673x473 image with a brush that is customizable in size and 9 colors. Due to the limitations of VB2008, it can only draw 9 colors: Red, Green, Blue, Magenta, Yellow, Cyan, Black, White, and Orange instead of RGB colors. Hard-coding all of the 16.5M colors would make this <500kB project into a >50MB one, so I'm not planning on fixing that YET. It can display all RGB colors if they are IMPORTED FROM AN EXTERNAL IMAGE from the Open Function. Anyways, enjoy this as it is my first program. ;)")>
