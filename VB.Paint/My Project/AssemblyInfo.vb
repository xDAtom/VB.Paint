<Assembly: AssemblyTitle("VB.Paint")> 
<Assembly: AssemblyDescription("VB.Paint is a lightweight image editing program. Coded in VB2008, it is very simple to use. The program features a brush which is very customizable. The brush's color can be changed by specifying RGB values. You can also change the shape into a circle or a square. There is also a Text Tool, which allows you to perfectly write text in Arial font on your drawing. The Open and Save functions are working like a charm. Enjoy this as it is my first program. ;)")>
