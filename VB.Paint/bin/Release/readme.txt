| HOW TO USE |
\------------/

First you need to create a image drawing environment. You can do that in three ways:
1. Pressing Ctrl+N
2. Clicking "New" under File in the Menu Strip
3. Clicking the New Mini-Button on the Menu Strip

On the right side, there is the Brush Panel. There you can modify Brush Size and Brush Colour. There is also a Brush Preview Panel.
Once you've modified that, draw on the Image using the mouse! While you are holding the Left Mouse Button, and moving the mouse, you are drawing alongside the path where you move the mouse.
When you want to erase the picture, do that in 4 ways:

1. Pressing Ctrl+F4, then Ctrl+N
2. Clicking "Close" under File in the Menu Strip, then clicking "New" under File in the Menu Strip 
3. Clicking the Close Mini-Button on the Menu Strip, then clicking the New Mini-Button on the Menu Strip
4. Erasing the Image manually using the White Brush.

Sadly, those couldn't be coded. I will add them once I figure out how.
