<Assembly: AssemblyTitle("VB.Paint")> 
<Assembly: AssemblyDescription("VB.Paint is a lightweight image editing program for fun! And yes I know it's crap. Coded in VB2008, it can only draw an 673x473 image with a brush that is customizable in size and 9 colors. Due to the limitations of VB2008, it CANNOT open nor save image files created in VB.Paint. Also it can only show 9 colors: Red, Green, Blue, Magenta, Yellow, Cyan, Black, White, and Orange because stupid VB2008 cannot edit the brush in the RGB way. And hard-coding all of the 16.5M colors would make this <500kB project into a >50MB one. So enjoy this as it is my first program. ;)")>
